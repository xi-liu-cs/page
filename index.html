<b>Statement of Purpose</b></br>
During my undergraduate study, I had several research experiences in nanomaterials/nanophotonics, physical simulation, molecular machine learning, and microscopy that shaped my interest in further hands-on research endeavors in utilizing nanofabrication and automation to develop innovative technology to address fundamental challenges in nanoelectronics, sustainable infrastructure, healthcare, and high performance computer architecture. I recognize the importance of acquiring additional background knowledge through relevant experimental courses whenever necessary to fortify my expertise in these multifaceted research domains. I envision my graduate work in laboratories involves a mixture of experimental and computational work that lies in the following areas:</br>
1. Nanofabrication of nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and biomedical devices (a). performing nanofabrication manually, (b). engineering automated robotics for manufacturing and construction, (c). developing computational/machine learning pipelines for device control</br>
2. Hardware software codesign of robotic and automation devices</br>
3. Machine learning and computer graphics simulation of atomic, molecular, and nanoscale phenomena (applications include automated nanofabrication and drug discovery)</br>
4. Engineering faster and lower power consumption processors, engineering noise-resistant and scalable quantum hardware nanomaterials and quantum processors</br>
5. Engineering chemical and biomolecular machines of nanomedicine and organic semiconductors, overcoming limitations in optical and electron microscopy for imaging of computing hardware and nanomedicine.<br>
</br>
Upon graduation from the graduate program, the gained advanced knowledge will open doors to innovative roles in research teams within high-tech companies, faculty and researcher positions in universities and national laboratories, or the establishment of my own company after sufficient practical breakthrough, enabling me to make significant contributions to the forefront of scientific and technological progress. Multiple possibilities exist for the creation of new companies that harness nanotechnology. After we solve the scalability and noise problems of quantum processors, the democratization of quantum processors, akin to the accessibility of GPUs, would revolutionize computing power and accelerate breakthroughs in diverse fields. In medicine, the ability to predict and control complex biological processes at the quantum level could revolutionize healthcare methods, drug discovery, and personalized treatments. The immense computing power unleashed by quantum processors could usher in a new era of high-fidelity computational experiences that are virtually indistinguishable from reality.</br>

I had a first-authored paper published by Elsevier Parallel Computing journal in collaboration with Professor Gizem Kayar and Ken Perlin. I addressed the complex challenge of simulating the interaction between microbiological agents and fluid dynamics, focusing on the intricate dynamics of microbial agents undergoing quorum sensing in a fluid environment governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. It was very difficult to develop the parallelized simulation since it is hard to discretize the Navier Stokes equations using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics model and it is even harder to simulate the reinforcement-learning-based microbial agent behavior and their interaction with fluid mechanical particles on the GPU's specialized hardware. Additionally, successfully implementing the GPU-based marching cubes algorithm for volumetric fluid mesh construction and 3D reconstructions of nanostructures led to the development of innovative approaches that accelerate GPU performance. These new developments led to the publication of a first-authored paper in the Elsevier Parallel Computing journal.</br>
</br>
In collaboration with Professor Saumya Saurabh, I am performing the wet lab experiments with a PhD student, and I am developing the microscopy pipeline that integrates stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to enhance 3D reconstructions of subcellular structure and dynamics with higher super-resolution while addressing challenges posed by multi-color imaging. dL5, in conjunction with Malachite Green (MG), enables enhanced, photostable protein labeling and super-resolution imaging in live Caulobacter crescentus cells, with minimal perturbation when fused to the intermediate filament protein CreS. The HaloTag is used in conjunction with the Janelia Fluor 549 (JF549) ligands, enabling efficient attachment of the JF549 fluorophore to biomolecular targets within cells. The data processing pipeline performs image registration and correlation on STED and STORM images through topographical mapping to target structures. We also aim to implement similar features that fuse images taken from STED and STORM. To mitigate the issues of channel crosstalk and inter-channel drift, the method uses a spectral demixing-based variant of direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (SD-dSTORM). This spectral demixing procedure inherently eliminates errors in multicolor registration and does not require multicolor channel alignment, resulting in precise colocalization experiments. Furthermore, it significantly reduces single molecule noise. Epipolar geometry and stereo matching techniques are used to achieve robust multi-color imaging and accurate 3D reconstructions of cellular nanostructures. This approach yielded remarkable lateral and axial resolution for studying intricate nanobiomaterials interactions. We are currently working on the paper.</br>

In collaboration with Professors Saumya Saurabh the fall of 2023, I worked in the modeling of Caulobacter crescentus motion in microcapsules. Using bright field microscopy, a graduate student collected motility data of C. crescentus. We identified the coordinating roles of its cellular appendages, and developed several motility modes: circling (lateral translation along the inner surface of the capsule), skating (larger angle precession of the bacterium), and spinning (small angle precession of the bacterium). My role in the project was to develop the hydrodynamic model that explains the different dynamics of locomotion observed in each motility mode and create numerical and 3D simulations that reproduce the different bacteria motility modes. Simulating the deformation of the crescent-shaped cell body geometry and the behavior of elastic filaments is a computationally demanding task. This complexity arises from the need to discretize and employ differential geometry techniques to accurately represent the stretching, bending, and twisting energy of the molecular motor. The hydrodynamics model is built on the slender body theory, resistive force theory, and discrete elastic rods theory, accounting for the forces and torques of the rotating flagella propulsion. We determined that pili played a pivotal role in surface mechanosensing, profoundly influencing cellular motility by providing adhesive and tensile forces. Moreover, the compartmentalization of capsule sizes significantly influenced filament length-dependent steady states, as interaction with capsule walls constrained flagellar extension and altered their orientation relative to the boundary. Our work holds significant implications for biomedical research, particularly in understanding bacterial surface adaptation as a crucial precursor to infection. A comprehensive paper detailing our findings is currently in the final stages of preparation for submission.</br>

In collaboration with Professor Alan Kaptanoglu, I spearheaded an initiative to enhance the accuracy of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) model, ensuring its resilience to noise and numerical errors. By refining the original code, I successfully minimized user dependence on predefining candidate functions, thereby enabling the model to autonomously discern the most relevant coefficients aligned with the spatiotemporal data. Notably, this advancement alleviated the challenge of ambiguous governing equations for system dynamics, facilitating a more intuitive and accessible application of SINDy across various scientific domains. Furthermore, my innovative modifications mitigated the disruptive effects of noise-induced chaotic behaviors, leading to predictions characterized by significantly reduced deviations. We will submit this paper soon.</br>
</br>
In summer 2023, since I was able to submit the last paper and received positive review decision, I discussed with Professor Gizem Kayar and we initiated a new project: the modeling of bacterial propagation in the air using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics model in my last paper. This project has high impact on the engineering of ventilation systems for operating theaters, in which airborne bacteria can cause wound infections from surgical procedures, and nanotechnology clean rooms. The crucial challenge in this project is there is very limited modeling work done in airborne bacteria. The central questions are how do we convince reviewers of the accuracy of the simulation of airborne bacteria and how to image them in situ as they are floating in the air. As I continued to perform simulations for bacteria airflow, it seemed that I needed a deeper understanding of the molecular interactions driving the motility of cellular autonomous agents to make the simulation more realistic to convince the reviewers. I also needed to acquire the necessary microscopic imaging skills to validate my simulation and reevaluate its accuracy each time I modify the governing partial differential equation, which lead me to contact to Professor Saumya Saurabh.</br>
</br>
In summer 2022, I collaborated with Professor Mohamed Zahran on the experimentation and investigation of general-purpose graphics processor architectures (GPGPUs) using CUDA PTX assembly language. I conducted a comprehensive analysis of parallel thread execution, memory utilization, synchronization, and execution on NVIDIA GPUs.</br>
